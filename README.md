Twitter users on map

This is a try to reproduce the result from the nice series of 3 articles by Daniela VÃ¡zquez (https://d4tagirl.com/2017/05/how-to-fetch-twitter-users-with-r)
It made a lot of fun to me and I have also changed some properties of the visualisation (pass 'T-labs' instead of 'RLadies' while the users searching and take time intervals in months instead of days since my dataset embraces almost 8 years and iterates by months are more appropriate)
