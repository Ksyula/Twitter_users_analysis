# Twitter_users_analysis
Twitter users on map

This toy project was a lot of fun and gave me a great opportunity to play around with the Twitter API, Google Maps API, and dynamic geo-visualization. 
Here's a short demo showing mentions of a specific hashtag (#T-labs â€” I was working at T-labs at the time! ðŸ˜Š) on Twitter across the globe over several months.

You are welcome to find the resulted dynamic and static visualisation in pictures folder.
